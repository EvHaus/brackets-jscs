brackets-jscs
=================

A Brackets extension that enables JSCS validation for Javascript files. For more information about JSCS see <https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs>.

JSCS can be configured by a .jscs.json file located in the project root directory.

Requirements
=====

Brackets Sprint 37 or greater

Configuration Files
=====

This extension will search for a **.jscs.json** file in your project's root directory, if not found, it will look for a **.jscsrc** file in your project's root directory, and if that isn't found either, JSCS will use a default configuration spec with no rules defined.

Enabling the Extension
=====

If you have disabled the default Brackets JSLinting service, you will need to manually enable JSCS in your prefs file:

- Go to Debug > Open Preferences File
- Make sure your `language.javascript.linting.prefer` definition includes "JSCS" as such:

```
"language": {
	"javascript": {
		"linting.prefer": [
			"JSHint",
			"JSCS"
		]
	}
},
```

Using with JSX
=====

JSCS (and brackets-jscs) can be used to validate JSX files. First you'll need to install `esprima-fb' via:

```
npm install -g esprima-fb
```

Then in your .jscsrc file, add the following line:

```
"esprima": "./node_modules/esprima-fb"
```

Now your JSX syntax should be properly parsed by JSCS via this extension and the commandline JSCS parser.

Release Notes
=====

**v0.5.0** (2015-05-07)

- Upgrade to latest node-jscs (v1.13.1) (Fixes #22)

**v0.4.0** (2015-04-07)

- Add support for custom `esprima` paths in the .jscs file. This allows us to use this extension for JSX files

**v0.3.0** (2015-03-25)

- Upgrade to latest node-jscs
- Remove support for JSX Transformation. It was causing too many issues. The behaviour of this extension will now work the same as running JSCS on the command line. We're looking into whether or not Babel (https://babeljs.io/) may be a good alternative for handling JSX processing through JSCS. This should fix issues #16, #17 and #19.

**v0.2.2** (2015-03-12)

- Fix for #15 Trailing space in comment breaks brackets-jscs

**v0.2.1** (2015-02-27)
